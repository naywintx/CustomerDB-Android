# Customer Database Android
[![Play Store](.github/playstore-badge.svg)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.georgsieber.customerdb)

With this Android app you can manage your customers separated from the private contacts, business appointments and vouchers. It is also available for [iOS](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-ios).

Optionally, you can set up your own sync server using the [Customer Database Server](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-server), which is also Open Source.

Contributions welcome :-)
